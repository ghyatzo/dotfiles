# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:

# font_family      Operator Mono Book
# bold_font        Operator Mono Thick
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium
# font_family      Input Mono

# font_family      Hack
# italic_font      auto
# bold_font        auto
# bold_italic_font auto

font_family        JetBrains Mono
bold_font          auto
italic_font        auto

# Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode characters.
# These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the monitor DPI to arrive at a
# pixel value. There must be four values corresponding to thin, normal, T H I C
# C and very T H I C C lines
# box_drawing_scale 0,0,0,0

# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the
# specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special
# rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for
# patched fonts. Each unicode code point is specified in the form U+<code point
# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name
#
# For example:
#
# symbol_map U+F000-U+F2E0 Font Awesome 5 Free
